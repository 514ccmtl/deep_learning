    "In this graded assignment, you will be asked to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. At each step, you'll be guided through the process of developing a model architecture to solve a problem. Your goal is to create a CNN that attains at least 30% accuracy on the validation set.\n",

    "### The CIFAR-100 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CIFAR-100 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 100 'fine' classes and 20 'coarse' classes. We will be looking at the 'coarse' classes.\n",

    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use Keras with TensorFlow to develop your CNN. For this assignment, it's strongly recommended that you use a GPU to accelerate your training, or else you might find it difficult to train your network in a reasonable amount of time. If you have a computer with a GPU that you wish to use, you can follow the [TensorFlow instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for installing TensorFlow with GPU support. Otherwise, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to complete this assignment. Colab provides free access to GPU-enabled machines. If you run into any issues, please make sure to email us as soon as possible so that we can help you resolve them."
